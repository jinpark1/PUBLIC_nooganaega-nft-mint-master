# NoogaNaega NFT Minting DApp

### Hosted on https://nft.nooganaega.com
### This is a public repo and does not include all the features shown on the deployed Dapp.

## Overview
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for NFT minting, specifically designed for the NoogaNaega collection on the Ethereum Mainnet. It offers a user-friendly platform for users to mint NFTs directly through a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet, with prior testing and validation conducted on the Goerli test network to ensure effectiveness and security.

## Key Features
- **NFT Minting**: Users can mint NFTs using a smart contract, ensuring a secure and decentralized process.
- **Test Network Validation**: The smart contract was thoroughly tested on the Goerli test network for security and functionality.
- **IPFS Integration**: Unique arts are integrated with IPFS, ensuring decentralized and permanent storage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The DApp provides an intuitive interface for a seamless minting experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity (Smart Contracts), Hardhat (Ethereum Development Environment)
- **Web3**: Alchemy, Web3-Onboard
- **Storage**: Firebase, IPFS (for storing NFT assets)
- **Testing**: Hardhat test scripts
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Other Tools**: Etherscan, MetaMask

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MetaMask (or any other Web3 wallet)

### Installation
1. git clone 
2. cd into directory
3. npm install

### Running the Project
npm run dev

## Challenges and Learning
One of the significant challenges was generating 9001 unique arts, creating Smart Contract, integrating them with IPFS, and incorporating them into the DApp. This process required careful consideration of various security aspects and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Future Enhancements
Future plans include expanding the DApp's functionality to allow users to connect their wallets and interact with additional smart contracts for staking, DeFi, swapping, and engaging in a social community.
