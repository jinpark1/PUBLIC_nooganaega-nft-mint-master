The way this is specified is by assigning each\n account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\n an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the\n time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.\n `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\n accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\n function.\n NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and\n tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected.

@dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":753,"linearizedBaseContracts":[753],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"630:12:4","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":721,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"649:792:4","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n For more information on the signature format, see the\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n section]."},"functionSelector":"d505accf","id":738,"implemented":false,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"permit","nameLocation":"1455:6:4","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":736,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":723,"mutability":"mutable","name":"owner","nameLocation":"1479:5:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1471:13:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":722,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1471:7:4","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":725,"mutability":"mutable","name":"spender","nameLocation":"1502:7:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1494:15:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":724,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1494:7:4","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":727,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1527:5:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1519:13:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":726,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1519:7:4","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":729,"mutability":"mutable","name":"deadline","nameLocation":"1550:8:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1542:16:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":728,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1542:7:4","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":731,"mutability":"mutable","name":"v","nameLocation":"1574:1:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1568:7:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint8","typeString":"uint8"},"typeName":{"id":730,"name":"uint8","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1568:5:4","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint8","typeString":"uint8"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":733,"mutability":"mutable","name":"r","nameLocation":"1593:1:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1585:9:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":732,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1585:7:4","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":735,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"1612:1:4","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":738,"src":"1604:9:4","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":734,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1604:7:4","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"1461:158:4"},"returnParameters":{"id":737,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"1628:0:4"},"scope":753,"src":"1446:183:4","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"external"},{"documentation":{"id":739,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1635:294:4","text":" @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract. The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter. `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release} function. NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"constructor\":{\"details\":\"Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at the matching position in the `shares` array.
